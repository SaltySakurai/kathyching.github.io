         <p> A little bit about me!</p>
         <p><img src="images/intro.png" alt = "Cartoon Me"> Hi, friends!
           Welcome to my page! My name is Kathy Ching! I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York
           all my life. I'm currently a undergraduate studying
         Integrated Digital Media at New York University! I'm very interested in Web Development, Game
       Design and Game Engineering! If I'm not at school, I'm either sipping coffee at a cafe, getting boba
       with my friends at Kung Fu Tea, playing Smash with my friends
       or catching some zzz's at home! </p>
